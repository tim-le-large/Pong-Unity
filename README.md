# le_pong with Unity

This is an implementation of reinforcement learning (Q-learning) playing the game pong.

This represents the direct playable version of my other [pong implementation in python](https://github.com/le-tim/le_pong.git).
Feel free to have a look at the result and try to win against my AI at [lelar.ge](https://pong.lelar.ge).
